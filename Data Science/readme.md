| [Car Price Estimation](https://github.com/dmitrii-naumenko/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/Car%20Price%20Estimation/car_price_estimation.ipynb) | A used car service is developing an app to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. Based on historical data, it is necessary to build a model to determine the value of the car.  | pandas, sklearn, imblearn, lgbm, xgboost, catboost, shap |
| [Data Science in Business](https://github.com/dmitrii-naumenko/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/Data%20Science%20in%20Business/oil_region.ipynb) | You have been provided with oil samples in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. Build a model to determine the region where mining will bring the most profit.  | business model, bootstrap |
| [Forecasting taxi orders](https://github.com/dmitrii-naumenko/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/Forecasting%20taxi%20orders/taxi.ipynb) | The taxi company has collected historical data on taxi bookings at airports. To attract more drivers during the peak period, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. A model is built for such a prediction.  | time series, pandas, sklearn, tensorflow, prophet |
| [NLP - Definition of toxicity comments](https://github.com/dmitrii-naumenko/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/NLP/text_toxic_classification.ipynb) | The online store launches a new service. Now users can edit and supplement product descriptions, just like in wiki communities. That is, clients propose their edits and comment on the changes of others. A tool is required that will look for toxic comments and submit them for moderation.  | nlp, bert, sklearn, imblearn, tensorflow, torch, lgbm, catboost, nltk |
| [CV - Age Determination](https://github.com/dmitrii-naumenko/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/CV/age_determination.ipynb) | A chain supermarket introduces a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group and control the conscientiousness of cashiers when selling alcohol. A model is being built that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. At your disposal is a set of photographs of people with age indication.  | nlp, bert, sklearn, imblearn, tensorflow, torch, lgbm, catboost, nltk |
