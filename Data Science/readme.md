| [DS Landscape](https://github.com/uberkinder/DS-landscape) | Pet project. DS Landscape is a web site and Telegram bot that helps to understand better relationships between skills and positions in Data Science. It also provides visualization of education courses on skills landscape. Our goal is to reduce the distance between the desired specialty and the process of obtaining skills.  | Embeddings, RecSys, Telegram Bot, Data Quality |
| AI for IT-Services | Developed services for automatic classification of applications and carried out advanced analysis. Developed a CV service to determine the number of people on the ladder at the airport | nlp, bert, cv, yolo, flask, dash, docker |
| [Car Price Estimation](https://github.com/dmitrii-naumenko/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/Car%20Price%20Estimation/car_price_estimation.ipynb) | A used car service is developing an app to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. There is model was build to determine the value of the car based on historical data.  | pandas, sklearn, imblearn, lgbm, xgboost, catboost, shap |
| [Data Science in Business](https://github.com/dmitrii-naumenko/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/Data%20Science%20in%20Business/oil_region.ipynb) | Provided oil samples in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. There is model was build to determine the region where mining will bring the most profit.  | business model, bootstrap |
| [Forecasting taxi orders](https://github.com/dmitrii-naumenko/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/Forecasting%20taxi%20orders/taxi.ipynb) | The taxi company has collected historical data on taxi bookings at airports. To attract more drivers during the peak period, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Forecast model was built.  | time series, pandas, sklearn, tensorflow, prophet |
| [NLP - Definition of toxicity comments](https://github.com/dmitrii-naumenko/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/NLP/text_toxic_classification.ipynb) | The online store launches a new service. Now users can edit and supplement product descriptions, just like in wiki communities. That is, clients propose their edits and comment on the changes of others. Designed a tool that will look for toxic comments and submit them for moderation.  | nlp, bert, sklearn, imblearn, tensorflow, torch, lgbm, catboost, nltk |
| [CV - Age Determination](https://github.com/dmitrii-naumenko/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science/CV/age_determination.ipynb) | A chain supermarket introduces a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group and control the conscientiousness of cashiers when selling alcohol. A model was built that determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph.  | nlp, bert, sklearn, imblearn, tensorflow, torch, lgbm, catboost, nltk |
