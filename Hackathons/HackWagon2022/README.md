As part of the ESG agenda and humane treatment of animals, Santa Claus purchased 90 thousand cars of various modifications by the New Year, but faced the problem of competent management of such a fleet.

  For timely delivery of gifts, "Navigator" and "Optimizer" are usually used, but since there is not enough time - there will be enough service that predicts the travel time from the departure station to the destination station on the entire railway network.

Create a service that will help grandfather.
